Senior Software Engineer at **Zillow** by day, agentic engineer by night. Neck-deep in the agent stack — cataloging the patterns that make LLM-powered systems actually work in production. Less vibes, more blueprints.

## 🚀 Current Projects

| | Project | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 🌐 | **[OpenAgentHub](https://openagenthub.io)** | A pattern catalog for architecting LLM-powered autonomous systems — agents that reason, use tools, remember, and self-correct. Framework-agnostic, model-agnostic, production-tested. |
| 🧠 | **[OpenMem](https://github.com/dunkinfrunkin/openmem)** | Deterministic memory engine for AI agents. Because agents that forget are just expensive autocomplete. |

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- **Mapping the agent landscape** — Turning scattered tribal knowledge about AI agents into structured, reusable architecture patterns
- **Memory systems for agents** — Building the primitives that let AI systems actually learn and retain context
- **Bridging demo → production** — Most agent demos break in prod. I'm documenting why, and how to fix it.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> "Patterns over frameworks." — I believe the best way to build reliable AI agents isn't picking the right library; it's understanding the underlying architecture patterns. Frameworks come and go. Good architecture compounds.

## ⚡ Random Facts

- 🍩 The username is exactly what you think it is — but plot twist, I'm a tea guy now
- 🤖 Runs multiple Claude instances like a one-man agent swarm
- 📐 Believes every AI system is just a graph of patterns waiting to be named
- 🎓 CS fundamentals enthusiast — from data structures to networking to AI
- 🍵 Powered by tea and the conviction that agents will eat software
- 📱 Loves building mobile apps just as much as shipping backend systems
